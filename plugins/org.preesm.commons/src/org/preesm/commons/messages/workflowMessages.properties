Workflow.browseScenarioTitle=Select an existing scenario file.
Workflow.FailedFindScenarioPlugin=Failed to find plugin of scenario node %VAR% from workflow.
Workflow.FailedFindTaskPlugin=Failed to find plugin of task node %VAR% from workflow.
Workflow.WrongScenarioPrototype=The edges of scenario %VAR% are not correct. Claimed prototype: %VAR%.
Workflow.WrongTaskPrototype=The edges of task %VAR% are not correct. Claimed prototype: %VAR%.
Workflow.StartInfo=Starting workflow execution: %VAR%.
Workflow.EndInfo=Workflow execution finished: %VAR%.
Workflow.OneScenarioNeeded=The workflow necessitates one and only one scenario.
Workflow.IgnoredNonConnectedTask=Ignoring non-connected workflow task.
Workflow.ExecutionException=Workflow execution of task %VAR% failed with exception message: %VAR%.
Workflow.ScenarioExecutionException=Workflow execution of scenario vertex failed with exception message: %VAR%.
Workflow.NullNodeOutput=Workflow execution of node %VAR% returned the output null.
Workflow.IncorrectOutput=The implementation of the workflow node %VAR% has not produced the necessary data %VAR%. Consider revising the workflow.
Workflow.CancellationRequested=The workflow execution was canceled by the user.
Workflow.EmptyVertexSet=The workflow has no vertex. The workflow file may be out of sync.
Workflow.FalseOutputEdge=The output port name %VAR% does not correspond to a data type in the node prototype. Use %VAR% to specify precedence and check the plugin extension.
Workflow.FalseInputEdge=The input edge %VAR% is necessary in the task and lacking in the graph.
Workflow.FalseInputType=The type of input data %VAR% is set to %VAR% by the predecessor while type %VAR% is set in the prototype.
Workflow.TooManyInputEdges=The task can not receive %VAR% input edge(s). The prototype specifies only %VAR% input edge(s).
Workflow.MissingAllParameters=The task %VAR% requires parameters (%VAR%) and did not receive any.
Workflow.MissingParameter=Missing task parameters: the task %VAR% requires parameters (%VAR%).
Workflow.Step=Workflow Step: %VAR%
