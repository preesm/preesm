/**
 * Computes a geometric sum. It takes three parameters: the first term a, the ratio r, and the number of iteration
 * (including the first term). Ex: geo_sum(3,1/2,4) = 3 + 3/2 + 3/4 + 3/8
 * <p>
 * It uses an iterative implementation (when |r| &lt 1) instead of the direct formula. The point is to avoid floating
 * point approximations.
